# My Creative Process

Every creative project starts with inspiration and planning.

## Finding Inspiration

I draw inspiration from:

- Nature and the outdoors
- Other designers and creators
- Art museums and galleries
- Everyday observations

## The Planning Phase

Before diving into design software, I always:

1. Define the problem clearly
2. Research similar solutions
3. Sketch ideas on paper
4. Get early feedback
5. Refine the concept

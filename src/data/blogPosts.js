## What a Month It's Been!

August has been absolutely packed with new experiences and creative projects. From discovering a new passion to diving back into game development, here's what I've been up to this past month.

## Discovering Pickleball

The biggest surprise of August has been **pickleball**! What started as a casual suggestion from friends has genuinely become something I look forward to every week.

What really draws me to pickleball is how **accessible** it truly is. There's no pretense or intimidation factor—just people who want to have fun and get some exercise. I've had genuine conversations and formed real friendships with people who are decades older than me and others who are much younger. It's rare to find something that brings such a diverse group together.

There's something beautiful about watching a 70-year-old share tips with a 20-year-old, both genuinely enjoying themselves. The sport is forgiving enough that you can jump in and start having fun immediately, but I'm already seeing how much room there is to grow and improve.

## GMTK Game Jam 2025

I also participated in the **GMTK Game Jam 2025** this month, and honestly, it reminded me why I fell in love with game development in the first place. For those who haven't experienced it, it's a 48-hour creative sprint where developers worldwide create games around a specific theme.

We created an **infinite runner** with a digital Tron-style aesthetic, and I'm genuinely proud of what we accomplished. The neon lights, grid patterns, and electronic soundtrack came together in a way that felt both nostalgic and fresh.

Game jams push you in ways that regular development doesn't. The time pressure forces you to trust your instincts and commit to ideas quickly. There's something liberating about that constraint—it strips away overthinking and gets you back to the core joy of creating something from nothing.

## YouTube Channel Revival

I'm also genuinely excited about getting back to my **YouTube channel**. I've been away for too long, and I really want to finish the **Marble Tutorial Series** I started. 

Those marble tutorials were my attempt to share what I've learned about 3D game development using Godot 4. I still get comments from people asking when the next episode is coming, and that means a lot to me. Knowing that something I created helped someone learn or sparked their curiosity—that's what makes all the editing and recording time worthwhile.

I have bigger plans for the channel too:
- More in-depth game development tutorials
- Honest behind-the-scenes looks at my creative process

There's something deeply fulfilling about teaching and sharing knowledge. The game development community has given me so much over the years, and I want to give back in whatever way I can.

## Looking Ahead

August has felt like a turning point for me. The new friendships from pickleball, the creative satisfaction from the game jam, and the renewed energy for YouTube—it all feels connected somehow.

I'm finding a rhythm that balances physical activity, creative challenges, and meaningful connection with others. It feels sustainable in a way that pure hustle never did.

Here's to carrying this momentum into September and beyond.

Thanks for reading this far. If you've tried pickleball recently or participated in any game jams, I'd love to hear about your experience. These shared creative and physical challenges seem to bring out the best in people.

## Welcome!

Hi there, and welcome to my website! My name is **Shane Huntoon**, and I'm excited to finally have a space to share my journey, projects, and passions with you.

## Who am I?

I'm a developer and creator who loves:
- **Game development**
- **Game art**

- **Cooking**

When I'm not working on digital projects, you'll probably find me experimenting in the kitchen—**cooking** is another big passion of mine!

## Why this website?

This is my **very first attempt** at building a personal website like this. My goal is to keep friends, collaborators, and anyone interested updated on:
- What I'm working on

I've had a **lot of fun** making this site and learning new things along the way.

## What to expect

Here, I'll be posting:

## Welcome!

Hi there, and welcome to my website! My name is **Shane Huntoon**, and I'm excited to finally have a space to share my journey, projects, and passions with you.

### Who am I?

I'm a developer and creator who loves:
- Game development
- Game art
- Coding
- Cooking

When I'm not working on digital projects, you'll probably find me experimenting in the kitchen—**cooking** is another big passion of mine!


<br />

### **Why this website?**


This is my **very first attempt** at building a personal website like this. My goal is to keep friends, collaborators, and anyone interested updated on:
- What I'm working on
- What I'm learning
- What inspires me

I've had a **lot of fun** making this site and learning new things along the way.

<br />

### **What to expect**

Here, I'll be posting:
- Updates about my latest projects
- Insights from my creative process
- Maybe even a few cooking adventures

I hope you'll find something here that **inspires or interests you**!

## Some of My Past Games

Here are a few snapshots from games I've worked on:
